            </header>
            <p>Contact the place of purchase or a bicycle dealer for information on installation and adjustment of the
                products which are not found in the user's manual. A dealer's manual for professional and experienced
                bicycle mechanics is available on <a href="http://si.shimano.com">our website</a>.</p>
            <p>Do not disassemble or alter this product.</p>
            <p class="bigger">For safety, be sure to read this user's manual thoroughly before use, and follow it for
                correct use.</p>

                Important Safety Information

            <h6>For replacement information, contact the place of purchase or a bicycle dealer.</h6>
            <h3 class="border-text-box">!!! WARNING</h3>
            <h6>When the shifting switch is operated, the motor which drives the front derailleur will
                    operate to the shifting position without stopping, so be careful not to get your fingers
                    caught.</h6>
            <p>It is important to suffi ciently understand the operation of the bicycle brake system. Improper
                use of your bicycle's brake system may result in a loss of control or a fall, which could lead to
                severe injury. Because each bicycle may handle differently, be sure to learn the proper
                braking technique (including brake lever pressure and bicycle control characteristics) and
                operation of your bicycle. This can be done by consulting your professional bicycle dealer
                and the bicycle's owners manual, and by practicing your riding and braking technique.</p>
            <p>If the front brake is applied too strongly, the wheel may lock and the bicycle may fall
                forward, and serious injury may result.</p>
            <p>Always make sure that the front and rear brakes are working correctly before you ride
                the bicycle.</p>
            <p>The required braking distance will be longer during wet weather. Reduce your speed
                and apply the brakes early and gently.</p>
            <p>If the road surface is wet, the tires will skid more easily. If the tires skid, you may fall off
                the bicycle. To avoid this, reduce your speed and apply the brakes early and gently.</p>
            <p>In the case of carbon levers, check before riding that there is no damage such as carbon
                separation or cracking. If damage is found, do not use it; contact the place of purchase or a
                bicycle dealer. Otherwise, the lever may break, and the braking operation may stop working.</p>
            <p>After reading the user's manual carefully, keep it in a safe place for later reference.</p>
            <h4>Note</h4>
            <p>Be sure to rotate the crank when carrying out any operations which are related to gear
                shifting.</p>
            <p>A software update with the E-TUBE PROJECT used after connecting to the wireless unit
                (SM-EWW01/EW-WU101/EW-WU111) enables the remote switch to operate. For details,
                consult the place of purchase.</p>
            <p>The components are designed to be fully waterproof and withstand wet weather riding
                conditions; however, do not deliberately place them into water.</p>
            <p>Do not clean the bicycle in a high-pressure car wash. If water gets into any of the
                components, operating problems or rusting may result.</p>
            <p>Handle the products carefully, and avoid subjecting them to strong shock.</p>

            <p>Be careful not to let water get into the E-TUBE port.</p>
            <p>Do not use thinners or similar substances to clean the products. Such substances may
                damage the surfaces.</p>
            <p>In the case of carbon levers, wash them with a soft cloth. Be sure to use a neutral
                detergent. Otherwise, the material may brake down and be damaged.</p>
            <p>Avoid leaving the carbon levers in places where high temperatures are present. Also,
                keep them far away from fire.</p>

            <p>Contact the place of purchase for updates of the product software. The most up-to-
                date information is available on the Shimano website.</p>

            <p>Also read the manuals for the brake and other equipment to be connected.</p>
            <p>Products are not guaranteed against natural wear and deterioration from normal use
                and aging.</p>
            <p>For maximum performance we highly recommend Shimano lubricants and maintenance
                products.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Before riding the bicycle, check the following items. If any problems are found with the
            following items, contact the place of purchase or a bicycle dealer.</p>
            <ul>
                • Do the front and rear brakes work correctly?
                • Does the brake lever have suffi cient freeplay?
                • Does the brake cable have any rust, fraying, or cracks?
                • Have the brake shoes worn down to the grooves?
                • Does gear shifting occur when the shifting switches are operated?
                • Are the levers securely installed to the handlebar?
                • Do any abnormal noises occur during operation?
            </ul>
