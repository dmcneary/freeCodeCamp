                    <p>Palisades del Rey was a neighborhood land development by Dickinson & Gillespie Co. - founded in
                        1921, the surviving remnants are known today as Playa del Rey. All of the houses in this area
                        were custom built, many as beach homes owned by Hollywood actors and producers, including Cecil
                        B. DeMille, Charles Bickford, and others.</p>
                    <p>In 1925 the developer held a contest to name the southern-most neighborhood, near what is now
                        Dockweiler State Beach, and awarded the $1,000 prize to an Angeleno who submitted "Surfridge."
                        The Los Angeles Times wrote that Surfridge was chosen "due to its brevity, euphony, ease of
                        pronunciation ... but above all because it tells the story of this new wonder city."</p>

                    <p>A small airstrip opened to the east of Surfridge in 1928, and saw increased traffic during and
                        after World War II. Propeller plane traffic noise was manageable, but jet travel soon proved
                        inhospitable to the neighborhoods below.</p>
                    <p>In the 1960s and 70s, the City of Los Angeles condemned the area under a series of eminent domain
                        claims. Access to the neighborhood today is restricted and the entire development was bulldozed
                        and fenced off.</p>

                        of the rare Burrowing Owl were sighted nesting in the preserve.</p>
